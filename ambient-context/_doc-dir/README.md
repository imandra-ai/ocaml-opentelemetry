ocaml-ambient-context
=====================

This OCaml module provides a API that is type- and dependency-abstracted across thread-local storage, Lwt's [sequence-associated storage](https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/blob/cc05e2bda6c34126a3fd8d150ee7cddb3b8a440b/src/core/lwt.ml#L727-L751 "Internal documentation for Lwt's SAS mechanism"), and Eio's [fiber-local storage](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio/pull/256 "ocaml-multicore/eio#256, adding a fibre-local storage API") — all different approaches to "throwing" information "across the stack" at runtime, without modifying interleaving methods/components/dependencies.

As a library author, depending on `ambient-context` allows you to

1. abstract some sort of application-provided information into something like "thread-local storage",
2. while still being compatible with dependants who are calling into you from an asynchronous context (like Lwt or Eio),
3. *without* functorizing your interface over (or even depending on!) specifically Lwt or Eio, or preventing non-Lwt/Eio users from consuming your API.

Simply put, `ambient-context` allows you to communicate with your dependants in situations where you cannot control intermediate dependencies, and cannot modify the API of your own library to accept a new parameter.

> [!WARNING]
> Ambient context like this — effectively, implicit global state — is usually frowned upon for most uses, and with good reason. This module is *intended* to be used as a last resort, and exclusively for debugging, tracing, and reporting purposes, if at all possible.

Installation and usage ...
--------------------------

The intended usage of this library is in two collaborating components:

1. that of a "deep in the dependency-tree" library (e.g. `foo-deep-lib`),
2. and a top-of-the-dependency-tree (e.g. `widget-app`).

The former needs to be able to obtain information from the latter, *without* changing the API presented to intermediate dependencies (e.g. `bar-intermediary-lib`) — and equivalently, without changing the function-signatures of intermediate wrappers/callers.

### ... as a top-level application

If a library you depend on (let's pretend it's `foo-deep-lib`) uses `ambient-context`, they're effectively deferring an important decision about _how_ their library communicates with you.

_This means you must to choose, and configure, a storage-mechanism relevant to the callsite(s) in your own application._

Your choice will vary depending on *from where*, in your own code, you're calling into a library that uses `ambient-context` — that is, whether an asynchronous event-loop (such as Lwt or Eio) exists 'above' your calls on the stack. Having determined whether you'll be calling your dependancy (e.g. `foo-deep-lib`) from such an asynchronous context , you'll then need to install the relevant storage-provider at runtime with an appropriately-placed call to `Ambient_context.set_storage_provider`.

> **Example:** if you're writing an Lwt-enabled application, and you'll be calling `bar-intermediary-lib` below the `Lwt_main.run` event-loop on the stack, you'll need to install the `ambient-context-lwt` "storage provider" ...

> ... and at runtime, your application will need to dictate the relevant storage backend (TLS, Lwt, or Eio) for a delineated section of the stack — usually, this involves wrapping the invocation of your asynchronous thread-scheduler's runloop — in this example, `Lwt_main.run`:
>
> ```ocaml
> (* src/widget_app.ml *)
> module Ctx = Ambient_context
>
> let () =
>    let sock = create_socket () in
>    let serve = create_server sock in
>
>    (* add this line before [Lwt_main.run]: *)
>    Ctx.set_storage_provider (Ambient_context_lwt.storage ()) ;
>    Lwt_main.run @@ serve ()
> ```

Once your application has configured the appropriate runtime context-storage, you'll presumably need to actually _use_ the ambient context in your calls to `foo-deep-lib`.

To communicate with transitive dependencies, you need an opaque `key` — these are usually created and exposed by your transitive dependency; see its documentation.

You can provide ambient values to the transitive dependency via calls to `Ambient_context.with_binding`; which takes that opaque `key`, the new `value` you want to set, and then a callback.

> **Example:** In our Lwt-enabled application, assuming `foo-deep-lib` takes advantage of the ambient context to communicate about a header it wants to add to HTTP requests, we can set that header in our application's top-level context, and it will be available to `foo-deep-lib`'s calls to `Curl`:
>
> ```ocaml
> (* src/widget_app.ml *)
> module Ctx = Ambient_context
>
> let () =
>    let sock = create_socket () in
>    let serve = create_server sock in
>
>    Ctx.set_storage_provider (Ambient_context_lwt.storage ()) ;
>    Lwt_main.run @@ fun () ->
>    Ctx.with_binding Foo_deep.header_context_key "my header value" @@ fun () ->
>       (* This empty [bind] may be necessary; see
>          {!Ambient_context_lwt.with_binding}. *)
>       Lwt.bind (serve ()) (fun () -> ())
> ```

Refer to your dependency's documentation for specific instructions on how to provide the ambient context they expect.

<!-- FIXME: v3.ocaml.org links for the backends' documentation -->
> [!NOTE]
> The precise semantics of `with_binding` depend on the chosen storage-backend; refer to your chosen backend's documentation.

### ... as a library

This library allows you to avoid depending on, or functorizing over, `Lwt.t`. In the most basic usage, you simply provide a `Ambient_context.key`, direct your consumers to the [above documentation](#as-a-top-level-application) and then anywhere in your API, you can pull the value 'currently' assigned to your key out of the ambient-context.

You need depend only on `ambient-context` itself, *not* `ambient-context-lwt`, or even `lwt` itself:

```diff
 ; dune-project
  (depends
   (ocaml
    (>= 4.08))
+  ambient-context
   (alcotest :with-test)
   (ocaml-lsp-server :with-dev-setup)
```

```diff
 ; lib/dune
 (library
  (name foo-deep-lib)
- (libraries curl pcre)
+ (libraries ambient-context curl pcre))
```

Use `Ambient_context.create_key` to create an opaque key for the value, and expose that to your user:

```ocaml
(* lib/foo_deep.ml *)
module Ctx = Ambient_context

let header_context_key : string Ctx.key = Ctx.create_key ()

(* ... *)
```

Then, anywhere you like, you should be able to obtain the value assigned to `Foo_deep.header_context_key` by the consuming application up-stack from you:

```ocaml
(* lib/foo_deep.ml *)
module Ctx = Ambient_context

(* ... *)

let http_request ?headers ?body action url =
   let open Curl in
   let headers =
      match Ctx.get Foo_deep.header_context_key with
      | None -> headers
      | Some header ->
         let header = "x-foo-deep: " ^ header in
         Some (header :: Option.default [] headers)
   in
   (* ... *)
```
