    @param batch
      the number of elements after which the batch will be considered {b full},

      [batch >= 0]. Default [1].

    @param high_watermark
      the batch size limit after which new elements will be [`Dropped] by
      {!push}. This prevents the queue from growing too fast for effective
      transmission in case of signal floods. Default
      [if batch = 1 then 100 else batch * 10].

    @param now the current time. Default [Mtime_clock.now ()].

    @param timeout
      the time span after which a batch is ready to pop, whether or not it is
      {b full}. *)
